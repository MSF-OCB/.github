# About Médecins Sans Frontières

Médecins Sans Frontières (aka MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) is a humanitarian organisation that provides medical assistance to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from healthcare.

Our teams are made up of tens of thousands of health professionals, logistic and administrative staff - most of them hired locally. Our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of impartiality, independence and neutrality. We are a non-profit, self-governed, member-based organisation.

We provide medical humanitarian assistance to save lives and ease the suffering of people in crisis situations in more than 70 countries.

We rely entirely on donations from individuals. 98 per cent of our 2023 income came from some 7.3 million private donors. It is thanks to the generosity of these private supporters – mainly individuals like you – that we are able to operate independently and provide humanitarian assistance in some of the world’s most insecure environments and forgotten crises.

We are a non-profit organisation and 80% of our financial resources are allocated to fulfilling our social mission: 64% to our humanitarian programmes, 12% to support our projects and programmes, and 3% to our bearing witness (témoignage) activities and Access Campaign activities. The rest is spent on general management and fundraising costs.
